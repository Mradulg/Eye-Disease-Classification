# Eye-Disease-Classification
Demonstrated the potential of Machine Learning driven solutions in healthcare for early detection and
prevention of eye diseases.

Developed a Convolution Neural Network(CNN) model using Python to classify approximately 4,000 retinal
images into four categories: Normal, Diabetic Retinopathy, Cataract and Glaucoma.

Achieved an impressive 86% accuracy on the training set and a robust 81% accuracy on the testing set.

Technology used: Python, Scikit-learn, Keras, TensorFlow, NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib
